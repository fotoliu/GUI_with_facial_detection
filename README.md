I have developed a GUI for facial recognition that integrates three custom-trained networks: AlexNet, VGG16, and a modified VGG16 designed specifically for grayscale images.
When you run incercare1.py, a GUI will appear, allowing you to choose one of the three available CNN models for classification.
Facial detection is handled by Haar Cascades.
